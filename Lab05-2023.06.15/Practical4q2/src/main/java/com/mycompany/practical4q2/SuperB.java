    There is a integer variable named x and there are 4 methods in the SuperB class.
    First method is setIt method. We use it to set x's value.
    Then the second method is increase and we use that method to increase x's value by 1.
    then the third method is triple and from that we triple the value of x.
    The last method is returIt method where we have to return the value of x.
